Sky+ IR Remote Codes as determined by the IRSky Software

NOTES:   
   
SKY+ IR remotes operate in two modes: SKY mode and TV mode. SKY Mode is activated when the SKY button is pressed 
and most buttons will then emit IR codes which use the RC6-6-20 protocol. The TV mode is activated when the TV 
button is pressed. The IR codes emitted in this mode are intended to control a TV, not the Sky box, and since 
TV's use a wide variety of IR protocols the codes output are dependent on the current TV setting of the SKY remote. 
If the SKY remote is configured to a Phillips TV then the output codes will be RC5. It is up to the user to configure
the Sky+ IR remote to the type of TV.
 
There are specific exceptions. Some buttons (Volume+/- and Mute) always emit the configured TV codes even in SKY mode. 
Some buttons (Play, Pause) send unknown (to me) codes in TV mode and some (TV Guide, Box Office) always toggle SKY mode 
back on and then send a SKY mode code. 

A Sky+ Rev4 IR Remote with a TV Mode configured using a four digit brand code of 0081 was used to determine these codes.
